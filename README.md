# 06/03/23 Lab - CSS

This lab was built on the previous exercise where I drew a wireframe and began building a website using HTML. It is difficult to ever declare a project such as this as "complete" but there were a few points I considered as MVP:

### MVP

- Attemped the Flexbox Froggy game to gain familiarity with the basics of Flexbox
- Attempted the CSS Grid Garden game to gain familiarity with the basics of CSS Grid
- Used my wireframe from the previous activity, add some styling _including at least one example of Flexbox **or** CSS Grid_

### Suggested Extensions

This isn't an exhaustive list as different things will be appropriate for different sites. 

- Nested Flexbox/Grid inside other sections as appropriate
- Made use of appropriate selectors 
- Added media queries to make my site responsive


## Part I: Flexbox

### Flexbox Froggy

Who doesn't love a bit of gamification? Flexbox can be a tricky thing to wrap your head around so to practice, I gave this game a go

Didn't need to complete all levels. I moved on once I was comfortable with each of the key flexbox-related properties introduced in the teaching.

## Part II: CSS Grid

### CSS Grid Garden

Akin to Flexbox Froggy above, CSS Grid Garden is an online game which aims to introduce the key properties of CSS Grid

Again, I didn't complete every level of this game provided I was comfortable with the content before moving on

### Additional Reading

CSS Tricks also have a fantastic article on CSS Grid for some further explanation of this concept:

## Part III: Adding Styling to your Website

Now it was time to truly realise my design! Using my previous wireframe and HTML document, began adding positional-based styling to my key design elements. Followed this up with some aesthetic properties

- Added styling to your webpage from the previous lab, took care to try best represent what I originally envisioned in my wireframe

To gain a better understanding of why my webpage didn't not look as intended initially, I investigated the DOM using the in-built browser Developer Tools. By first selecting an element within the `Elements` tab, I was then able to see what styling was being applied below (under `Styles`)

Perhaps the reason an element isn't how I at times expected was due to an invalid assigned value or some default styling getting in the way

If my styling was not appearing in the list below, I double checked that I imported my stylesheet properly!
